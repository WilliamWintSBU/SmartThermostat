# SmartThermostat
DIY smart thermostat using an ESP8266 Arduino Breakout Board

This project was made for HACK@CEWIT 2023 at Stony Brook University. The first and seccond commits to main were all made by be in a little over a day. I used hardware that was avaiable to borrow from the coordinators.

It did not impress the most of the judges, but maybe you will like it better! I may work on it more eventually.

Feel free to use the code for whatever you want, LMK if you do somthing cool with it.
